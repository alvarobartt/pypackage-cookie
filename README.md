## Features

This cookie provides the following features:

* A complete Python package skeleton including all the main standards used while creating and uploading a proper Python package.
* [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for testing Python package functions.
* [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) continuous integration so as to test that the package works properly after each commit.
* Integration with [Codecov](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/services/devops/pipelines/) so as to get to know which source code lines are hitted and which of them are missed.
* Additionally, other CI tools such as [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/services/devops/pipelines/) or [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
* [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) automatic developer documentation generated from function docstrings, rStructuredText & Markdown files, which can lated be hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/).
* and much more that will be progressively included...

## Installation

Firstly, you will need to install [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) using pip from a Python3.5 version or higher since **this cookie recipe just works on Python3.5+**; use the following command:

``pip install cookiecutter``

So as **to create your own cookie from this recipe you will need to clone this repository** using the following command:

``git clone https://github.com/alvarobartt/pypackage-cookie``

Once it is properly cloned, from the working directory, you will need to **pass the cloned cookie as an argument to the cookiecutter entry point** as it follows:

``cookiecutter /path/to/pypackage-cookie``

This command will launch the **cookiecutter prompt into your terminal**, which will ask you some configuration options as specified in the cookie recipe for you to select the most suitable ones according to your needs.

So to bake this cookie, the cookiecutter prompt will ask you to select the following ingredients (configuration) in case you want to name your cookie (project), for example, lets suppose that your project will be named `awesome_cookie` its configuration will be:

```
author [Alvaro Bartolome del Canto]: Cookie Monster
email [alvarobartt@example.com]: cookiemonster@sesamestreet.com
github_username [alvarobartt]: cookie-monster
project_name [Python Package]: awesome-cookie
project_description [This project is a sample Python Package]: This is an awesome cookie!
repo_name [awesome_cookie]: 
package_name [awesome_cookie]: 
pypi_username [cookie-monster]: 
version [1]: 
Select license:
1 - MIT License
2 - BSD License
3 - ISC License
4 - Apache Software License 2.0
5 - GNU General Public License v3
6 - WTFPL License
7 - None
Choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 [1]: 1
```

When this process is finished, automatically a directory named as specified in `repo_name` will be created containing the following files and directories:

``awesome_cookie/  docs/  LICENSE  MANIFEST.in  README.md  requirements.txt  setup.cfg  setup.py  tests/``

**Congratulations! You already baked your own pypackage-cookie!**

## Usage

**Once the cookie is completely baked, you can take it off the oven!** So on, from the `repo_name` previously created directory, you can install it using pip by typing: ``pip install .`` and modify it as you need to in order to fit your needs.

Since it is a Python package, if it is an open source one, in order to upload it to PyPI so that every user can download and install it, you will need to:

- Go to your Github repo URL and access the tab called `Releases`.
- Then, click the button `Draft a new release` so as to create a new project release version. (Note that the version number of the release should be the same as specified on the `version` attribute, which will need to be updated before drafting every new release at https://github.com/alvarobartt/pypackage-cookie/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.repo_name%7D%7D/setup.py).
- Once the release is created, you need to be placed on the project's directory root, where the `setup.py` file is.
- Before uploading it, you will need to create a new ZIP file from source code, which will be done using: ``python setup.py sdist``. The previous command will create the new ZIP file under the `dist/` directory.
- In order to upload it to PyPI, you will need to install `twine` which is an utility for publishing Python packages using the command: ``pip install twine``
- Once installed, you need to cd into the recently generated `dist/` directory.
- Finally, you will just need to upload it to PyPI using the following command: ``twine upload /path/to/package-version.zip`` and access with your PyPI credentials.  

**Now you are completely free to eat your cookie!**
