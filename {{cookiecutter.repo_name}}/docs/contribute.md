## Contribute

As this is an open source project it is **open to contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas**. There is an open tab of [issues](https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}/issues) where anyone can open new issues if needed or navigate through them in order to solve them or contribute to its solving. Remember that **issues are not threads to describe multiple problems**, this does not mean that issues can't be discussed, but so to keep a structured project management, the same issue should not describe different problems, just the main one and some nested/related errors that may be found.
