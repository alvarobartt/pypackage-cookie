## Installation

In order to get this package working you will need to **install it via pip** (with a Python3.5 version or higher) on the terminal by typing:

``$ pip install {{ cookiecutter.package_name }}``

Additionally, **if you want to use the latest version instead of the stable one**, you can just use the following command:

``$ pip install git+https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}.git@developer``

**The developer branch ensures the user that the most updated version will always be the working and fully operative** so as not to wait until the stable release on the master branch comes out (which eventually may take some time depending on the amount of issues to solve).
